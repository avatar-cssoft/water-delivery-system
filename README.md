# Water Delivery System

CSSOFT1 Software Engineering 1 project by Team Avatar (BSCS IAB1, University of Baguio, SY 2026-2027).

A web and mobile app where customers order water refills, pick a delivery slot, pay by cash or e-wallet, and track their order. Riders get a daily delivery list, and admins manage stock, prices, containers, and reports. The AI feature is an agentic workflow using Small Language Models (SLMs) for chat ordering and dispatch suggestions.

## Branches

* `main` holds reviewed, merged work only.
* Work on a feature branch named after its GitHub issue number, for example `feature/12-role-based-access`, and merge it through a reviewed pull request.
* Write `Closes #12` in the pull request description so the issue closes and its card moves to Done on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/avatar-cssoft/projects/1) when the pull request merges.
* Older branches and commits use Jira keys (`SCRUM-19`). Each GitHub issue lists its old Jira key at the bottom.

## Tech stack

* React + TypeScript, built with Vite
* React Router for pages
* Supabase for the database and auth (`@supabase/supabase-js`)
* GitHub Actions CI runs lint and build on every pull request
